# DC TECH

This app is a take home interview.  Requirements are to access the Flickr and
Instagram APIs and retrieve all photos with the #dctech hashtag.  Uses React
and jQuery.  Photos need to be posted within the past month and are ranked,
from most commented to least commented, top to bottom left to right.  

Hovering over photos shows the amount of comments made, you can spin up a simple server by typing in
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
in your command line and navigating to localhost:8000/public to see the app
